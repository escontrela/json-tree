# JSON TREE Features

## Imported File Metadata

- The application exposes a dedicated import use case that accepts a local JSON file path.
- Import metadata is normalized into a workflow-friendly result object with absolute path, filename, size, and basic availability flags.
- JavaFX controllers are expected to consume the use case result instead of reading file metadata directly from the filesystem.
